## My process

- First Created HTML Strucute
- Styles through TailwindCSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss CSS

Even though I had used HTML and Tailwind CSS before, revisiting this project helped me:

- Regain fluency with utility-first CSS and layout structure using Tailwind
- Practice writing cleaner and more semantic HTML
- Work with responsive images using the `hidden` and `block` classes based on screen size
- Refresh best practices like accessibility (`alt` text, button semantics)
- Build muscle memory for spacing, sizing, and card-based UI design
